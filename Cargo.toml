# Add other necessary build dependencies here, e.g., cssparser, regex if needed by build script logic
# For now, only serde_json seems directly needed for command.json parsing in build.rs
# The actual CSS parsing and code generation logic will be ported from src/lib.rs and src/main.rs,
# so those dependencies (cssparser, regex) might be needed if that logic is directly used in build.rs
# or if we call functions from the library that need them.
# Let's assume the library functions will be called.
